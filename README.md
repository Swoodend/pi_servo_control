# Servo Control

This is a small library used to control a (model here) servo with the Raspberry Pi Zero.

### to run main

- execute `python main.py --ON_TIME hh:mm` from `/servo_control`
- ON_TIME format is hh:mm (24 hour clock) so 1:35pm would be `--ON_TIME 13:35`

### to run unit tests

execute `python -m unittest tests.test_time_logic` from project root
